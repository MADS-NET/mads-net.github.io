    "text": "What is it\nMADS-NET is a simple framework for implementing a network of distributed agents that can exchange information via ZeroMQ.\nIt is made by a main set of executables available in the MADS tools collection repo, which also provides installers for Linux, MacOS and Windows.\nThe MADS tools collection includes a broker and a set of general purpose agents that can act as sources, filters, or sinks. The actual operations performed by agents can be customized either via scripting languages (using simple popen interface), or by implementing dedicated plugins in C++.\nSome of the available plugins are:\n\narduino_plugin: reads from a serial connected arduino\nhpe2D_plugin: performs human pose estimation from a camera stream\nmqtt_plugin: acts as a bridge with an MQTT network\nsay_plugin: Text-to-speech of incoming messages\nble_plugin: Bluetooth Low Energy source plugin\ntui_plugin: Terminal User Interface for sending metadata commands to MADS network\nlua_plugin: Interfacing Lua scripts to the MADS network (useful for prototyping and rapid development)\n\nThere are also additional monolithic agents:\n\npython_agent: Interfacing Python3 scripts to the MADS network (useful for prototyping and rapid development)\n\nLook into the guides section for more information on how to use the MADS tools collection."
