# What is it?

MADS stands for *Multi-Agent Distributed Network*

## Contents

* Terminology
* Basic Usage
* Linux services
* Plugins
* Parallel computing


# Terminology

## Let's get understood...

- **Agent**: an entity that can perceive its environment and act upon it.
- **Network**: a set of agents, possibly distributed over different devices or machines, and exchanging information via ZeroMQ/TCP connections

MADS aims at being as transparent as possible w.r.t. the underlying network. 

The same MADS network could run 

* on a single machine (via loopback connections) 
* as well as on multiple machines (via TCP connections), one agent per machine

And everything in between...


## MADS Network Topology

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
To maximize flexibility and scalability, MADS networks are **broker-based**

* only IP/hostname of broker is needed
* broker does message dispatching
* agents can filter messages by **topics**
* agents can be added/removed dynamically
* agents can act as source (blue), filter (green), or sink (orange)

## It's a ZeroMQ network

MADS uses [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/){target="_blank"} as the underlying communication layer:

* connections are established via TCP (XPUB-XSUB)
* order of connection does not matter
* disconnection/reconnection is handled automatically
* minimum overhead w.r.t. other protocols (e.g., HTTP, gRPC, REST)
* application-layer protocol is agnostic to the underlying transport, and left to the user
* MADS is designed to be simple, so data on the wire is presented as JSON compressed with [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy){target="_blank"}
* MADS is designed to be scalable: you can have hundreds of agents, the limiting factor being network bandwidth


## Agents

:::columns
:::{.column width="70%"}
Agents are the building blocks of a MADS network. They can be:

- **Sources**: produce data and send it to the network
- **Filters**: process data received from the network and send it to other agents
- **Sinks**: consume data from the network and perform actions based on it

Agents can be implemented in any programming language that supports ZeroMQ, but MADS provides C++ API that abstracts ZeroMQ intricacies.

## Agents

:::columns
:::{.column width="70%"}
Using MADS API, agents can be implemented as:

* **monolithic**: a single executable that contains all the logic
* **plugin-based**: a general purpose executable that loads plugins dynamically, allowing for modularity and extensibility; the user only has to develop the plugin with minimal boilerplate code and API knowledge
* **Python modules**: MADS agent can load at runtime Python modules that provide a proper interface (2-3 functions)

:::aside
Plugins are actually shared C++ libraries, compiled with minimal dependencies

## Implementation

* MADS is implemented in C++17 and provides an API to create agents and connect them to the network
* It can be compiled on Linux, macOS, and Windows
* Compilation is rather tedious and has a number of dependencies, but:
  - [installers](https://github.com/pbosetti/MADS/releases){target="blank_"} are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows
  - a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/p4010/mads){target="blank_"} is available for easy setup 
* Developing custom agents as plugins is much easier, as it requires only a few functions to be implemented
* Example plugins are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mads-net){target="blank_"}
* The main MADS command can generate a plugin template


# Basic usage

How do we use it in practice?


## Main command: `mads`

* The standard installers provide a main command: `mads`
* Inline help is available with `mads --help`:
  ```sh
  > mads --help
  Mads command line interface version 1.3.1
  Usage:
    mads [OPTION...]
  
    -i, --info     Print information on MADS installation
    -p, --prefix   Print MADS install prefix
        --plugins  List plugins in default plugins directory
    -v, --version  Print version
    -h, --help     Print help
  ```

* Options `-i` and `-p` are useful to check the installation


## Mads subcommands

* The list of available `mads` sub commands can be obtained as:

:::columns
:::column
```sh
> mads
Available mads subcommands:
   filter (wraps mads-filter)
   worker (wraps mads-worker)
  command (wraps mads-command)
    image (wraps mads-image)
 feedback (wraps mads-feedback)
  logging (wraps mads-logging)
   plugin (wraps mads-plugin)
   source (wraps mads-source)
   bridge (wraps mads-bridge)
     sink (wraps mads-sink)
   dealer (wraps mads-dealer)
   python (wraps mads-python)
   logger (wraps mads-logger)
   broker (wraps mads-broker)
      ini (internal)
  service (internal)
```
:::

:::column
* On MacOS and Linux, commands are available as e.g. `mads source` or `mads-source`
* On Windows, commands are available as e.g. `mads-source` only
* *internal* commands are implemented by the `mads` executable
* Man pages are available (e.g. `man mads-source`)
:::
:::

  
## Launching the `broker`

```sh
> mads broker
Reading settings from /Users/p4010/usr/local/etc/mads.ini [broker]
Binding broker frontend (XSUB) at tcp://*:9090
Binding broker backend (XPUB) at tcp://*:9091
Binding broker shared settings (REP) at tcp://*:9092
Timecode FPS: 25
Settings are provided via tcp://127.0.0.1:9092
CTRL-C to immediate exit
Type P to pause, R to resume, I for information, Q to clean quit, X to restart and reload settings
```

* Line 2 and 7 report a fundamental aspect: the **centralized settings file**
* Settings for all agents are stored in a [TOML](https://toml.io){target="_blank"} file, which is dispatched by the broker to the agents upon launch
* Each agent is launched with the settings URL (e.g. `tcp://127.0.0.1:9092`) as a command line argument


## Running an agent

:::columns
:::column
* To run an agent on a device different from the one running the broker, we need to specify the broker address
* We see relevant agent settings (loaded from broker):
  - pub topic: messages are tagged with `publish`
  - compression: JSON compressed with snappy
  - timecode: all messages generated in the same 40ms share the same timecode
  - timecode offset: clock difference with broker

## Logger

* MADS provides an agent called `logger` for logging messages
* The `logger` is designed to store data into a [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com){target="_blank"} database
* MongoDB is **schemaless**, so it can store any JSON data published to the MADS network
* Each agent publishes on a given **topic** (e.g. `publish`)
* For each topic, a corresponding table is created in the database, and each message is stored as a document in that table
* [MongoDB aggregations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/){target="_blank"} can offload some computational load and make data easier to fetch

:::callout-note
A MongoDB instance can be easily started with Docker:
```sh
> docker run -d --name mads-mongo -p 27017:27017 -v ${PWD}/db:/data/db mongo
```
:::


# Services

Automate it!

## MADS services

On Linux machine only, MADS provides a service file generator that can be used to run MADS agents as system services, **automatically active on boot**

Procedure:

1. define the proper launch command, e.g. `mads source -s tcp://mads-broker.local:9092 -n my_datasource`
2. run `mads service my_datasource source -s tcp://mads-broker.local:9092 -n my_datasource`; this prints a possible `systemctl` file for a service called `my_datasource.service`
3. if it looks correct, run the same command as `sudo`: this installs the service on the system dir
4. enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable my_datasource.service`

# Plugins

Or, please, make it easy!


## Motivation

* MADS is designed to be simple, but it can be complex to implement agents
* Implementing an agent (monolithic) requires knowledge of the MADS API, ZeroMQ
* Compiling the agent takes time and requires a proper development environment, especially on Windows
* We wanted to let users focus on the **agent logic**, not on the boilerplate code
* At the same time, we wanted to keep the advantages of C++ (performance, low-level control, etc.), without *forcing* users to revert to scripting interfaces just because the whole C++ framework is too complex

**Solution**: MADS plugins


## MADS plugins

* A plugin is a shared library that implements a specific agent logic
* Plugins are loaded dynamically by the MADS general purpose executables:
  - `mads source`: provides information to the network (e.g. by reading sensors)
  - `mads filter`: processes data received from the network and sends it to other agents
  - `mads sink`: consumes data from the network and performs actions based on it (e.g. by writing to a file)
* The specific agent logic is implemented in the plugin, which is a C++ class that inherits from a base class
* MADS provides the `mads plugin` command to create a plugin template

:::aside
Also see the [guide page](/guides/plugins.qmd) for more details on plugins
:::



## Running `mads plugin`

:::columns
:::column
* The `mads plugin` command creates a plugin template in the current directory
* The template contains a `CMakeLists.txt` file and a `src` directory with the plugin source code
* The template has minimal dependencies:
  - A C++17 compliant compiler (VS 2017 or later, GCC 7 or later, Clang 5 or later)
  - CMake 3.15 or later
  - Any other dependency must be added to `CMakeLists.txt`
* CMake can be configured to install the plugin in the MADS plugins directory, so that the plugin is automatically found

## Plugin class details

```c++
class My_sourcePlugin : public Source<json> {
public:
  // Implement the actual functionality here
  return_type get_output(json &out,
                         std::vector<unsigned char> *blob = nullptr) override {
    // Your logic to fill 'out' with data
    // optionally use 'blob' for binary content
  }

  // Run only once upon start
  void set_params(void const *params) override {
    // Optional: handle parameters passed to the plugin
    // This can be used to configure the plugin at runtime
  }
private:
  // custom fields here
};
// Macro that does the magic of allowing dlopen to work
INSTALL_SOURCE_DRIVER(My_sourcePlugin, json)
```

## Plugin class details

* Implementing a plugin does not require knowledge of the MADS API
* Only two methods (three methods for filter plugins) need to be implemented
* Any third party library is left to the user:
  - add necessary `find_package` calls in `CMakeLists.txt`
  - link the library to the plugin
  - include the necessary headers in the plugin source code
* The plugin source code also has a template `main()` function: beside each plugin, a one-shot executable is provided (and compiled) that can be used to test the plugin logic without the need of a MADS network

:::aside
**Note**: the `CMakeLists.txt` provides an `add_plugin(name SRCS <source lists> LIBS <libraries list>)` macro that simplifies the process of creating a plugin target
:::


## OTA plugins

* Plugins can be loaded **Over-The-Air** (OTA) by the `mads source`, `mads filter`, and `mads sink` commands
* If the INI file contains an entry like this:
  ```toml
  [my_source]
  attachment = "/path/to/my_source.plugin"
  ```
  then that file (on the broker filesystem!) is sent to `my_source` agents when they connect to the broker
* This allows to have all plugins in a single location, and to update them without having to manually copy them to each agent machine


# Parallel computing

MADS can be also use for dispatching parallel computations on HPC clusters


## The *dealer-worker* model

Suppose that you want to explore a large domain of parameters for a simulation to perform **sensitivity analysis** or **parameters optimization**:

:::columns

:::column

* ZeroMQ provides a special *PUSH-PULL* communication model between a single **dealer** and multiple, identical **workers**
* The **dealer** distributes tasks to the **workers** in a round-robin fashion
* Each **worker** processes the task and sends the result back to the broker
* In a possible implementation, a **source** provides the grid of parameters combination and a **logger** agent store the results

## The MADS implementation

In MADS, there are two special agents for this purpose: `dealer` and `worker`

* `dealer`: receives the computational payloads (simulation input) from a suitable source agent, and dispatches them to the workers
* `worker`: receives the computational payloads and uses a custom plugin to process them (of type *filter*), then sends the results back to the broker

Ideally, the worker plugin is launched in $n$ instances on a Kubernetes cluster; each instance loads the computational plugin OTA from the broker
